I ran a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jeenalee/chicken-inspired-improvised-woven-art?ref=5g4ufo&token=d77bf698) in February-March 2021.

The idea was that the backer would choose one of the five chicken breed options, and I would weave an art inspired by that chicken breed (and an additional clue if they provided one to me).
